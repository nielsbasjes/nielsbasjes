### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Niels Basjes.

I work as an IT-Architect/Inventor at [https://www.bol.com](https://partner.bol.com/click/click?p=2&t=url&s=2171&f=TXL&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bol.com%2Fnl%2F&name=github) where I design new systems that are usually special on some way when it comes to handling data.

I'm also an avid opensource contributor and you'll find patches of me in lots of Apache "BigData" projects.
Committer for Apache Flink and Comitter/PMC for Apache Avro.
